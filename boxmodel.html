        <h1>What is hydraulic actuator?</h1>
        <div>
          A hydraulic actuator is a mechanical device that uses pressurized hydraulic fluid to produce motion. It typically consists of a cylinder or motor that transforms hydraulic pressure into linear or rotary motion. The main function of hydraulic actuators is to control the movement of machinery and equipment by converting fluid pressure into mechanical energy.
